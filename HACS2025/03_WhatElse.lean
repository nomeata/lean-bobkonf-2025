What else does Lean offer?
==========================

For the user:
* interactive programming/proving experience
* type-guided autocompletion
* call hierarchy
* incremental and parallel proof processing
* in-editor evaluation

For the programmer:
* call-by-value purely functional programming
* compiles to native code (via C)
* no GC, mutable in-place updates

For the mathematician:
* Based on dependent type theory
* “Pragmatic” axioms
  (funext, proof irrelevance, quotients, classical logic)
* Small trusted code base
* powerful tactics
  `simp`, `omega`, `fun_induction`, bitvectors & SAT
* Huge mathematical library (`mathlib`)
  (including more tactics, `ring`, `aesop`)

For the meta-programmer:
* Very extensible syntax, hygienic macros
* Extensibe tactics
* Lean is Lean’s metaprogramming language
